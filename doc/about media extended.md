In Media Extended plugin version 3.2.6, there are the following issues:

1. Playlist function does not work properly.
2. Media Note function does not work properly. Specifically, every time you take a screenshot or add a timestamp, it cannot find the existing Media Note and creates a new one instead.

Both of these functions can be fixed by reloading the Media Extended plugin (these issues do not occur when the plugin is first enabled). You can use the Lazy Plugin Loader plugin to automatically reload the Media Extended plugin when loading Obsidian to resolve this.
